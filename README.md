# Extended Description

Theme: Cultural Preservation

## Problem  
3D modelling and preservation of cultural heritage is time consuming, expensive and looked over. This in turn makes temples, monuments and sculpture hard to preserve \[6\]. There is evidence of struts from collapsed temples being used in other temples after major earthquake damage \[1\]. Our shared history and culture is lost to the elements. Cultural context such as colours, texture,etc cannot be accurately captured by traditional methods and their authenticity after reconstruction is often under question \[2\]\[3\].

## Solution  
We propose an open source application with integrated 3D model generator, editor and viewer.These models can be then used to restore, repair or reconstruct while maintaining the complete cultural context of their original existence \[4\].

## Methodology  
With accessible smartphones and drones with high resolution cameras we can hand over the cultural preservation of artefacts to the people. A general smartphone /drone user can upload a series of images or videos of a cultural site or an idol and obtain a ready to use 3D model for  archival, CAD, VR, etc \[5\]. 

## Merits of Digital Devalaya Project:

- Accessible and low barrier to entry  
- Cultural enrichment via collective effort  
- Free and open source  
- Captures complete cultural context

While we discuss the cultural preservation potential these also serve tourism and digital economic growth.

A typical user does the following:  
Step1: Obtain camera / drone footage of idols, temples, monuments.  
Step2: Upload the footage to Digital Devalaya website.  
Step3: Obtain the 3d model and other necessary assets  
Step4: Use the models and assets for archival, AutoCad, VR, blender,etc
